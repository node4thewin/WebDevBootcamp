<!-- Attributes

    Attributes are a way that we add additional information to our HTML elements.
    They take the form of a key-value pair. Basically means a property and a corresponding value.

    <tag name="value"></tag>  -->

<!-- image can be something that is hosted (like a URL) or a file on your server. For now we are focusing on "hosted" images. -->

<!-- the "a" tag stands for anchor tag. it helps create links to other pages. Google searches are a bunch of anchor tags. -->


<a href="www.google.com">try dis</a>

<a href="http://www.google.com">Fuckin click here bro</a>


<!-- without the http:// it stuck with the FTP protocol, hence why it didnt go to the right website. -->

<!-- sometimes i will want to get a URL to a file using FTP or the local server so then I'll do the following... -->

<a href="divs_and_spans.html">GO TO DIVS BROOO</a>

<!-- this could be as simple as a "page2.html" -->

<a href="page2.html">page 2 brahh</a>
