<!-- this is the TRADITIONAL way to tie CSS to HTML, however this won't work because of what's below. Check out the aboutme.html for a clean version -->

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="app.css">

<!-- you can also write some css inside of an html file (below) -->
    <style type="text/css">
/*  selector {
    property: value;
    }*/
    h1 {
        color: purple;

    <li style="color: purple;">Playing Tarkov</li>

<!-- now we want CSS to be contained in it's own file since it's just the style -->
