<!-- This is how you add tables in HTML, this will also introduce CSS so you can style the tables and add border/colors etc. -->

<!-- Inside each <table> element you must have a <tr> or "table row" element. inside eache <tr> or table row element you must have a <td> element

There are multiple ways to do this. -->

<!-- Let's try another table -->

<!-- Name   Age
===========
Rusty  2
Wyatt  13 -->

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Age</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Rusty</td>
        <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Wyatt</td>
        <td>13</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<!-- HTML5 is about having things with more meaning...so what we do is use a few more elements like  <thead> and a <tbody>. <thead> just signifies the bolded heading of the table. It does not affect the visuals but it does add more information to the structure of the website. -->

 <table border="1">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Age</th>
        <th>Breed</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Rusty</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>Mutt</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Wyatt</td>
        <td>13</td>
        <td>Golden</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
